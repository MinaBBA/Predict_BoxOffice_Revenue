Trivia
    The sound that Palkia makes in this film is derived from the sound of Boga the Varactyl from Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith (2005). Here, it is also mixed with sounds that Godzilla (Gojira (1954)) and King Ghidorah (Ghidorah, the Three-Headed Monster (1964)) make.        See more  »

Trivia
    Throughout the movie, Hulk does not revert to Bruce Banner despite being either knocked out or in a calm state. Writer Greg Johnson offers the explanation that Sakarr's atmosphere is toxic to humans and so Hulk cannot change back or else he will die as Banner. Director Sam Liu, on the other hand, states that the cosmic rays that flooded Hulk's ship before crashing on Sakarr might have altered him in some way.        See more  »

Trivia
    This is the last film of Andrey Krasko who died suddenly a few weeks after the shooting's end. He hadn't time to perform the dubbing, so Semyon Furman gave his voice to the main character and did it perfectly well: the voice of Krasko being very specific, it's practically impossible to notice the substitution without knowing it beforehand. Ironically, this is also the first film in which Andrei Krasko plays a main character, all previous movie career of this brilliant and successful actor consisting of cameos and supporting parts. Amongst many actors regarded as candidates for the part of Viktor Tyrsa, Krasko was the only one who rejected the superstitions and agreed to play a man who travels between life and death.
